# MattermostAPI

I use Mattermost API to find my token authentification with my login and my password
After that I can post a message in Mattermost Channel


Soon I can choose my team and my channel. ( Now the channel is wrote on my code :/ )
And do everything with Mattermost API.
Create user, find my user informations, create channel, get a lot of data...

Any other Ideas ?
